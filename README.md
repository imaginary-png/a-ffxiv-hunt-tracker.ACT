# a-ffxiv-hunt-tracker.ACT
ACT Plugin for UFHT(a-ffxiv-hunt-tracker)

<b>ALL IT DOES AT THE MOMENT IS ALLOW YOU TO OPEN UFHT.EXE VIA IN-GAME COMMAND.</b>

<b>THIS ONLY OPENS A SEPARATE PROGRAM. IT JUST MAKES THINGS A LITTLE MORE CONVENIENT.</b>

Requires: https://github.com/imaginary-png/a-ffxiv-hunt-tracker

# Installation

ADD INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS HERE


# How to use

Add your directory via the ACT plugin tab 

Open UFHT by typing '/ufht' into the chatlog.

Requires Error Message logging to be enabled.

This can be enabled via the cogwheel on the bottom-right of the chatbox -> General -> Announcements -> Error Messages  


### ToDo
  Maybe remake as a proper plugin, if there is any demand.  
  Currently opening the exeternal app via in-game command is convenient enough for my personal use.
